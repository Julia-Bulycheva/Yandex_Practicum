## Project 1: The research on the quality of a mobile application for selling food products

In this project, the principles of event analytics were utilized. I constructed a sales funnel, examined user journeys leading to a purchase, and analyzed the results of an A/B test for the introduction of new fonts. I compared two control groups to ensure proper traffic allocation and then compared them to the test group. It was found that the new font had a negligible impact on user behavior.

## Project 2: Analysis-of-business-indicators

Task for a marketing analyst at the entertainment app Procrastinate Pro+. Despite significant investments in advertising, the company has been running at a loss for the past few months. The task is to investigate the reasons behind this and help the company turn a profit. Data analysis from ProcrastinatePRO+ has been conducted. Various metrics have been calculated, including cohort analysis: LTV, CAC, Retention rate, DAU, WAU, MAU, etc. Metric calculation functions were used, and conclusions were drawn based on the obtained data.

## Project 5: Searching for patterns that determine the success of a computer game

Using data on video game sales, user and expert ratings, genres, and platforms, patterns determining the success of a game were identified. Parameters determining game success in different regions of the world were also identified. Based on this, a report was prepared for a computer game store to plan advertising campaigns. Data preprocessing and analysis were conducted, and a relevant time period for analysis was selected. User profiles for each region were created. Hypotheses were tested: whether the average user ratings for the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same and whether the average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different. The Student's t-test for independent samples was used for the analysis.
