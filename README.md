## The research on the quality of a mobile application for selling food products

In this project, the principles of event analytics were utilized. I constructed a sales funnel, examined user journeys leading to a purchase, and analyzed the results of an A/B test for the introduction of new fonts. I compared two control groups to ensure proper traffic allocation and then compared them to the test group. It was found that the new font had a negligible impact on user behavior.
