**Opening a Coffee Shop Suggestions**

To actively attract visitors during the coffee shop's opening phase, the optimal price for a cup of cappuccino is suggested to be determined as follows.

Depending on the geographical location of the coffee shop, you need to establish the average price of a cup of cappuccino in the best coffee shops in Moscow. Then, either set the same price or reduce it depending on the chosen customer attraction policy.

If you plan to open a coffee shop in the districts of Moscow with the lowest income levels, it can be assumed that here the price of a cup of cappuccino reflects the pricing policy of food service facilities. Network establishments or those willing to maximize cost reduction at the expense of service quality can afford a pricing policy of this kind. When opening a new food service facility, it initially operates on reputation - this is quality plus a slightly lower price compared to competitors because customers will not initially visit a new food service facility with low levels of service.
