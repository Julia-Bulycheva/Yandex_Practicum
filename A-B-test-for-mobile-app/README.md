# The research on the quality of a mobile application for selling food products

In this project, the principles of event analytics were utilized. I constructed a sales funnel, examined user journeys leading to a purchase, and analyzed the results of an A/B test for the introduction of new fonts. I compared two control groups to ensure proper traffic allocation and then compared them to the test group. It was found that the new font had a negligible impact on user behavior.

# Project objective

The aim of this project was to study the behavior of users of a startup - a mobile application that sells food products. During the project, the following tasks needed to be addressed:

Understand how users navigate through the application to make a purchase.
Determine how many users reach the purchase stage and how many get stuck at the previous steps.
Identify the specific steps where users tend to drop off.

To address these tasks, an analysis of the results of an A/A/B experiment was conducted. During this experiment, users were divided into three groups: two control groups with old fonts and one experimental group with new fonts.

Creating two A groups instead of one had certain advantages in ensuring the accuracy of the experiment and detecting factors that led to result distortions.

# Technology Stack

Python with the following libraries:
- pandas
- scipy
- numpy
- matplotlib
- math
- scipy
- stats

# Project Status

Project completed.

# Key results and conclusions

Based on the results of the A/A/B experiments, the following was determined:
- which font is more user-friendly for the application users;
- how much time and data will be needed for further tests.
