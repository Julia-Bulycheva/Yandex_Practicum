# Research on Apartment Sale Listings

Based on data from the Yandex.Real Estate service, the market value of various types of real estate properties and typical apartment parameters were determined, depending on the distance from the city center. Data preprocessing was carried out, and new data were added. Histograms, box plots, and scatter plots were constructed.

# Key results and conclusions

The analysis of the provided data showed the following:

1. The majority of apartments for sale have a total area ranging from 25 sq. m to 75 sq. m, with the highest number of apartments having a total area between 40 and 50 sq. m. Apartments with a total area exceeding 150 sq. m are considered elite properties and make up a small portion of the total listings. Kitchen area for these apartments ranges from 5 to 14 sq. m, with the most common kitchen sizes being 7.9 and 11 sq. m. As kitchen area increases beyond this range, the number of listings decreases.

2. The most common price range for apartments for sale is from 3 to 5.5 million rubles. These apartments are typically one or two-bedroom units with a ceiling height of 2.5 meters. They are primarily located in low-rise buildings (five floors). Most apartments for sale are on floors that are not the first or the last, which is expected as there are fewer physically available apartments on these floors. The number of apartments on the first and last floors is not significantly different.

3. The top-selling apartments are in five-story buildings, followed by apartments in nine-story buildings (more than 3000 listings). Apartments in 12, 16, and 25-story buildings share the third position.

4. Apartments in the dataset are located within a range of 11 to 17 km from the city center, with the majority of apartments falling within 10 to 40 km from the airport. There are numerous parks in St. Petersburg and its surroundings, often within walking distance.

5. Price dynamics over the years is noteworthy. From 2014 to 2016, apartment prices decreased, but from 2016 onwards, they gradually began to rise. Most apartments are listed for sale in November, December, and February, with a decrease in business activity by May. On average, it takes 101 days to sell an apartment, with a sale within 44 days of listing considered relatively quick.

6. Apartments in St. Petersburg are the most expensive, while the cheapest ones are in Vsevolozhsk. The closer an apartment is to the city center, the higher the price per square meter.

These findings provide insights for understanding the real estate market in the region and can be used for various purposes, including pricing strategies and investment decisions.
